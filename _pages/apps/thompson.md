## Thompson sampling for contextual bandits

This app allows you to calculate treatment assignment probabilities using Thompson sampling.
Assignment probabilities are proportional to the posterior probabilities that a given treatment is optimal, conditional on covariates.

Thompson sampling and the hierarchical prior used for this app are described in Section 3 of [adaptiveexperimentspolicy.pdf](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/files/papers/adaptiveexperimentspolicy.pdf).
