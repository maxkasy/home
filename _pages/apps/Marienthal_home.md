## Study design
Our study design is based on two approaches:
1. The first approach uses individual-level pairwise randomization of participants into waves.
2. The second approach constructs a synthetic control at the municipality level.

We consider multiple different treatment contrasts to separate out direct effects of program participation, anticipation effects of future participation, and municipal level equilibrium effects.

## Program description

- All residents who are a minimum of 9 months in unemployment are eligible to participate.
- Participation is voluntary.
- The preparatory training phase is scheduled for a maximum of eight weeks. 
- After completion of the training phase, participants join the job guarantee program.

## Timeline

- October 2020: Coaching starts (first wave of 31 participants).
- December 2020: Start of employment (first wave of 31 participants).
- February 2021: Coaching starts (second wave of 31 participants).
- April 2021: Start of employment (second wave of 31 participants).
- The program continues for (at least) 3 years up to March 2024.

### Historical notes

- Our study took place in the same location as a famous study of unemployment in the 1930s, "Marienthal; the sociography of an unemployed community," by [Marie Jahoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Jahoda), [Paul Lazarsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld), and [Hans Zeisel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zeisel).
- Our visualization at the beginning of the dashboard draws on the "Isotype" system developed by [Otto Neurath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Neurath).
