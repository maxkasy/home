## Workshop announcement

### Beyond single-agent decision theory
The current decision-theoretic foundations of statistics and machine learning are insufficient for addressing some of the key challenges facing science and society today.
First, there are pressing concerns about the social impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning, regarding issues such as fairness, inequality, and value alignment.
Single-agent decision theory is insufficient for conceptualizing the underlying conflicts of interest between different agents, or the value alignment issues resulting from divergent objectives.  
Second, there is a perceived replication crisis of empirical research, which might be due to p-hacking or publication bias.
This crisis has motivated proposed solutions such as pre-registration of statistical analyses and reforms of the publication system.
Single-agent statistical decision theory again cannot make sense of these problems and solutions, as it does not allow for conflicts of interest between different parties, private information, or dynamic inconsistency.

### Workshop format
The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for extended in-depth interaction, and the development of research agendas, formulating “big open questions,” with collaboration across disciplinary boundaries, to further the foundations of statistics and machine learning. 
This workshop will involve speakers from econometrics and economic theory, computer science, and philosophy.
The workshop will start with a series of *tutorial lectures*.
The goal of these lectures is to bring all participants on the same page, especially with regards to the relevant state of research in other disciplines.
These will be followed by talks on *frontier work*.
In these talks, the speakers will give an overview of their own work, and other related frontier work.
The workshop will conclude with an open-ended panel discussion on big *open questions*.




## Registration (for attendees)

Speakers at this workshop have been personally invited.
Attendance at the tutorial lectures and frontier talks is open to all, both in person (subject to space constraints) and online (via Zoom).
