## Overview

This webpage provides information for the informal Machine Learning (ML) and Economics group at the Department of Economics, University of Oxford, coordinated by Maximilian Kasy.

The goal of this group is to discuss research and develop a common research agenda at the intersection of ML and economics.
The focus is on conceptual and methodological contributions of economics to ML and of ML to economics.
These two fields share a common language in the frameworks of optimization, probability, and decision theory.
Economics has much to contribute to ML with its considerations of multiple agents, inequality and conflicting interests, and private information.
ML has much to contribute to economics with its insights on supervised and active learning, considerations of non-traditional data types, and adaptive decision-making.
Special emphasis will be put on the social impact of ML, and on non-commercial applications of ML.


## Activities

### Upcoming

- Bi-weekly **reading** and discussion **group** on ML and economics, meeting in even weeks of term, starting in HT 2022.
- On June 20 2022, we will organize a small **cross-departmental workshop** on ML and economics, with presentations of ongoing work and discussants, as well as external keynotes. Details to come.  
Michael Jordan from UC Berkeley is a confirmed keynote speaker.  




### Previous

- I started teaching a new **MPhil course** on the foundations of ML for economists in HT 2022.  
All faculty, post-docs, and doctoral students are invited to audit this course and participate in discussions.  
Syllabus, slides and readers can be found here:
[Foundations of Machine Learning](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/ML_Oxford_2022/)
- In April 2021, we organized a **conference** on [Machine learning and economic inequality](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/ML_inequality_conference/). Recordings of the talks are available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB3VHmtU-Acta1o0wbzWaag/videos).
