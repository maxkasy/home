## Workshop announcement

### Bringing together theory, empirics, and methodology for an economic analysis of knowledge production

Science is a collective process of knowledge production.
As such, science is often characterized by conflicting interests, inequalities, externalities, agency problems, and misaligned incentives.
The consequences range from p-hacking and publication bias to scientific fraught, from insider clubs to hype cycles.
How can the tools of economics shed light on these issues?
And what recommendations can we derive for empirical methodology and for the institutions of science and science funding?
We will discuss these questions from the perspectives of econometrics, microeconomic theory, and empirical microeconomics.



### Workshop format
The goal of this workshop is to provide a venue for extended in-depth interaction, and the development of research agendas, formulating “big open questions,” with collaboration across field boundaries. 
In doing so, this workshop builds on last year's workshop on [Social foundations for statistics and machine learning](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/social_foundations_workshop/).

This workshop will involve speakers from econometrics, economic theory, and empirical economics.
The workshop will start with a series of *tutorial lectures*.
The goal of these lectures is to bring all participants on the same page, especially with regards to the relevant state of research in other sub-fields.
These will be followed by talks on *frontier work*.
In these talks, the speakers will give an overview of their own work, and other related frontier work.
The schedule will allow for extended discussions after each talk.



 
## Registration (for attendees)

Speakers at this workshop have been personally invited.
Attendance at the tutorial lectures and frontier talks is open to all, both in person (subject to space constraints) and online (via Zoom).
